AI-Powered Bicep Curl Detection using MediaPipe & OpenCV


This project presents a real-time exercise monitoring system that detects and counts bicep curls using human pose estimation. Leveraging MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV, the system tracks arm landmarks, computes elbow joint angles, and identifies complete curl motions based on angular movement. The repetition count is updated only when a full curl cycle is detected, ensuring accuracy.

The application visually displays curl progress, percentage completion, frame rate, and total repetitions, making it suitable for fitness analytics, AI-driven workout assistants, and smart gym solutions. The modular design allows easy integration into larger health and fitness platforms.
